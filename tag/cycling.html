<p><a class="reference external" href="/images/just_ride/book.png">Book cover</a></p>
<p>I've just finished reading an enjoyable book about cycling called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Just-Ride-Radically-Practical-Equipment/dp/0761155589">Just ride</a>,
(a radically practical guide to riding your bike).
It's an interesting book for anyone who just wants to get on a bike and enjoy
it, without being forced to adopt a sports bike attitude to riding.</p>
<p>It's aimed at all casual riders who ride a bike for commuting or just for
the sheer enjoyment.</p>
<p>The book is slit up into 8 parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Riding</li>
<li>Suiting up</li>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Heath and Fitness (Don't confuse the two)</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
<li>Upkeep</li>
<li>Technicalities</li>
<li>Velosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Within these sections are short sub sections which cover a page or two, and are
essentially advice/tips.</p>
<p>Some examples of sub-sections are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No ride too short</li>
<li>The shoes ruse</li>
<li>Gloves: the least necessary accessory</li>
<li>Kickstands, not balancing acts</li>
<li>Your bike is a toy. Have fun with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you a flavour of the attitude the writer Grant Petersen takes, when
it comes to cycling (he's been riding a bicycle daily for over
30 years). He promotes the term <strong>Unracer</strong> for those of
us who are not trying to compete in the Tour de France, and not wanting
to appear like they <em>have all the gear, but no idea</em>.</p>
<p>This book focuses on the practicality of riding a bike and not on looks or
ultra thin racers. This is not aimed at those people who spend thousands on
the latest sports bike - to basically ride 5 miles to work on.</p>
<p>It's full of good tips and advice and it's a really
quick read, and something you can pick up and start reading at any point
within the book.</p>
<p>The last page of the book is a short quiz to see if indeed you are a Racer or
Unracer. If by the end of reading this book you answered true to 6 or more
of these questions, your an unracer, and as Grant says:</p>
<p>-- &quot;..likely to have a lifetime of good riding ahead of you.&quot;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having read this book I now have a rear view mirror attached to the handlebar
insert, this is not something I would have purchased without reading this book,
and has made me feel more confident on the road, and I'm now not stretching
my neck out to look behind me.</p>
<p>I'd recommend reading this book if you are like me, a casual rider, who just
wants to get on and enjoy cycling, and doesn't buy into the latest and
greatest <em>improvements</em> that are designed mainly for those who think they are
going to be the next Bradley Wiggins.</p>
<p>Just ride a bike and above all, enjoy it.</p>
